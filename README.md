# Geometric deep lean learning Evaluation using a Twitter social network

The goal of this work is to evaluate a deep learning algorithm that has been designed to predict
the topological evolution of dynamic complex non–Euclidean graphs with discrete–time in which links are
labeled with communicative messages. This type of graph is able to represent, for example, social networks
or complex organizations such as the networks associated with Industry 4.0. In this paper, we first introduce
the formal geometric deep lean learning algorithm in its essential form. We then propose a methodology to
systematically mine the data generated in social media Twitter which resembles these complex topologies.
Finally, we present the evaluation of a geometric deep lean learning algorithm that allows for link prediction
within such data–bases. To provide proof of work that our algorithm predicts the topology and information
embedded within it, we present a case study and show that it is able to provide high accuracy in the link
prediction of a re–tweet social network with benchmark levels of accuracy and computation time.
